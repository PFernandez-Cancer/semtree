## How to contribute?

Contributions to this package are welcome. Ideally, talk to the developer team
first before you start coding new features. This helps us to keep the package
consistent, compatible and create the best user experience for semtree users.
We prefer code contributions as pull requests because this allows the developer
team to discuss changes before they are merged within in the main branch. If
you are interested in contributing and would like to start a discussion on
a new feature or a bug fix, please open an issue in the semtree github repository.
